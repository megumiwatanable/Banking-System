## 🔍 Overview

**Banking System** is a RESTful backend that models the core of a retail banking platform: customer onboarding, multi-account ownership, and money movement (deposits, withdrawals, transfers) backed by an immutable transaction ledger.

It is written as a modular monolith organized around the `user`, `account`, and `transaction` business capabilities, with a strong emphasis on **correctness under concurrency** (row-level locking, deadlock-avoidance ordering) and **defense-in-depth security** (stateless JWT auth, BCrypt hashing, per-endpoint rate limiting). The schema is version-controlled with Flyway rather than left to Hibernate auto-DDL, and reads are accelerated with a Redis-backed cache.

This is not a toy CRUD demo — it implements the two hardest problems in a banking backend correctly: **atomic double-entry money transfers between two independently-locked rows**, and **stateless authentication without leaking authorization state**.

---

## ✨ Feature Set

### 👤 Identity & Access
- Self-service registration (`full name`, `email`, `password`) with server-side uniqueness enforcement (both a pre-check and a DB unique-constraint fallback).
- Stateless **JWT** login — no server-side session store.
- Authenticated profile read/update (`GET/PUT /api/user/me`) and password change with re-verification of the current password.
- Passwords are **never** returned in any API response (`@JsonIgnore` on the entity field) and are hashed with **BCrypt** before touching the database.

### 🏦 Account Management
- Multiple accounts per user, typed as `SAVINGS` or `CURRENT`.
- Cryptographically random 10-digit account numbers (`SecureRandom`), guaranteed unique via a retry loop against the database.
- Balances are `DECIMAL(19,2)` end-to-end (Java `BigDecimal` ↔ MySQL `DECIMAL`) — **no floating-point money**.
- A database `CHECK` constraint prevents balances from ever going negative at the storage layer, independent of application logic.

### 💸 Transactions
- **Deposit**, **Withdraw**, and **Transfer** operations, each producing an immutable row in the `transactions` ledger.
- Transfers are atomic: either both the debit and the credit succeed, or neither does.
- Transaction history queryable globally (scoped to the caller), by transaction ID, or by account.
- Every transaction is stamped with a `TransactionType` (`DEPOSIT` / `WITHDRAW` / `TRANSFER`) and a `TransactionStatus` (`PENDING` / `SUCCESS` / `FAILED`).

### 🛡 Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Rate limiting** on every `/api/**` route via a custom `@RateLimit` annotation, backed by **Bucket4j** token buckets cached in **Caffeine** — with tighter, hand-tuned limits on auth and money-movement endpoints, and looser defaults elsewhere. `429` responses carry a `Retry-After` header with the real wait time.
- **Redis-backed response caching** (`@Cacheable`) on hot read paths (account lookup, user profile, transaction history).
- **Centralized exception handling** — a single `@RestControllerAdvice` maps 10 custom exceptions + framework exceptions (validation, optimistic/pessimistic locking failures) to precise HTTP status codes with a consistent JSON error envelope.
- **OpenAPI 3 / Swagger UI** auto-generated and publicly browsable at `/swagger-ui.html`.
- **Flyway**-versioned schema — three migrations create `users`, `accounts`, and `transactions` with explicit constraints, indexes, and column comments.
- Health/info actuator endpoints exposed for basic liveness monitoring.

## 🏗 Architecture

The application is a modular monolith: one deployable Spring Boot process and one database, with code grouped by business capability. Each module contains its own API, application logic, domain model, and persistence adapter. JWT authentication, rate limiting, errors, and framework configuration are shared infrastructure.

**Module responsibilities**

| Area | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Filter** | Authenticates the request statelessly by validating the JWT and populating `SecurityContextHolder`. No filter-level authorization — everything past this point is "authenticated or not." |
| **Interceptor** | Enforces per-identity, per-endpoint request quotas before the controller method ever runs. |
| **Controller** | Thin HTTP adapters — validate the request body (`@Valid`), delegate to a service, map the result to a `ResponseEntity`. |
| **Service** | All business rules live here: ownership checks, balance math, locking strategy, cache annotations, transaction boundaries (`@Transactional`). |
| **Repository** | Spring Data JPA interfaces; one repository (`AccountRepository`) carries a custom `@Lock(PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)` query. |
| **Database** | MySQL enforces the invariants the application *should* uphold anyway (uniqueness, non-negative balances, referential integrity) as a last line of defense. |

See [the modular monolith guide](Docs/modular-monolith.md) for package boundaries and dependency direction.
The [financial services API guide](Docs/financial-services-api.md) describes the CASA, customer, asset, credit-rating, and simulated CITAD modules.

## 🗄 Database Design

The schema is Flyway-versioned (`V1`–`V5`) with explicit constraints rather than relying on ORM auto-generation. Core ledger tables are supplemented by customer profile, CASA enrollment, asset, credit-rating, and CITAD inquiry tables.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USERS ||--o{ ACCOUNTS : owns
    ACCOUNTS ||--o{ TRANSACTIONS : "sends (nullable)"
    ACCOUNTS ||--o{ TRANSACTIONS : "receives (nullable)"

    USERS {
        bigint id PK
        varchar full_name
        varchar email UK
        varchar password "BCrypt hash"
    }

    ACCOUNTS {
        bigint id PK
        varchar account_number UK
        varchar account_type "SAVINGS | CURRENT"
        numeric balance "CHECK >= 0"
        bigint user_id FK
        bigint version "optimistic lock"
    }

    TRANSACTIONS {
        bigint id PK
        varchar transaction_type "DEPOSIT | WITHDRAW | TRANSFER"
        numeric amount "CHECK > 0"
        timestamp transaction_time
        varchar status "PENDING | SUCCESS | FAILED"
        bigint sender_account_id FK "nullable"
        bigint receiver_account_id FK "nullable"
    }
```

**Notable schema decisions**

- `ck_accounts_balance_non_negative` and `ck_transactions_amount_positive` are enforced **in the database**, not just in Java — a bug in application code cannot silently create a negative balance or a zero/negative-amount transaction.
- `sender_account_id` / `receiver_account_id` are both nullable *by design*: a `DEPOSIT` has no sender, a `WITHDRAW` has no receiver, a `TRANSFER` has both. A `ck_transactions_parties_present` constraint guarantees at least one is always set.
- Accounts reference users with `ON DELETE CASCADE`. Transaction foreign keys use the default restrictive delete behavior: accounts referenced by transaction history cannot be deleted. This preserves the party-presence CHECK constraint under MySQL.
- `idx_transactions_transaction_time DESC` supports the "most recent first" access pattern used by every transaction-history endpoint.

## 🔄 Core Flows

### 1. Registration & Authentication

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as User
    participant C as UserController
    participant S as UserServiceImpl
    participant DB as MySQL
    participant J as JwtService

    U->>C: POST /api/user/register {fullName, email, password}
    C->>S: register(request)
    S->>DB: existsByEmail(email)?
    alt email taken
        S-->>C: 409 ResourceAlreadyExistsException
    else email free
        S->>S: BCrypt.encode(password)
        S->>DB: save(User)
        S-->>C: 201 UserResponse
    end

    U->>C: POST /api/user/login {email, password}
    C->>S: login(request)
    S->>DB: findByEmail(email)
    S->>S: BCrypt.matches(password, hash)
    alt credentials valid
        S->>J: generateToken(email)
        J-->>S: signed JWT (HS256, 24h expiry)
        S-->>C: 200 {token, tokenType: "Bearer", ...}
    else invalid
        S-->>C: 401 InvalidCredentialsException
    end
```

Every subsequent request carries `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The `JwtAuthenticationFilter` verifies the signature and expiry, extracts the email as the principal, and — critically — grants **no authorities**. This means the system currently has exactly two access states: *authenticated* or *anonymous*. There is no role hierarchy (see [Limitations](#-known-limitations--findings)).

### 2. Deadlock-Safe Money Transfer

The transfer path is the most interesting piece of engineering in this repository. Two different accounts must be debited and credited atomically — but locking them in an arbitrary order (e.g., always "sender first") is a classic deadlock trap: if User A transfers to User B at the same instant User B transfers to User A, each transaction locks its own sender first and then blocks forever waiting for the other's lock.

This codebase avoids that by **always acquiring locks in ascending account-ID order**, regardless of who is sender and who is receiver:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as User
    participant C as AccountController
    participant S as AccountServiceImpl
    participant DB as MySQL

    U->>C: POST /api/account/transfer {senderAccountNumber, receiverAccountNumber, amount}
    C->>S: transfer(request)
    S->>S: reject if senderAccountNumber == receiverAccountNumber
    S->>DB: resolve both account numbers to account IDs
    S->>S: firstId = min(senderId, receiverId)<br/>secondId = max(senderId, receiverId)

    Note over S,DB: Locks are always taken low-ID → high-ID,<br/>never sender-first — this is what prevents deadlocks

    S->>DB: SELECT ... FOR UPDATE WHERE id = firstId (5s timeout)
    DB-->>S: locked row
    S->>DB: SELECT ... FOR UPDATE WHERE id = secondId (5s timeout)
    DB-->>S: locked row

    S->>S: resolve sender vs receiver from the two locked rows
    S->>S: verify caller owns the sender account
    alt insufficient balance
        S-->>C: 400 InsufficientBalanceException
    else lock timeout
        S-->>C: 409/423 AccountLockTimeoutException
    else success
        S->>S: sender.balance -= amount<br/>receiver.balance += amount
        S->>DB: save(sender), save(receiver)
        S->>DB: INSERT INTO transactions (TRANSFER, SUCCESS)
        S-->>C: 200 AccountResponse
    end
```

Deposits and withdrawals follow the same pattern with a single locked row: `findByIdForUpdate` takes a `PESSIMISTIC_WRITE` lock with a 5-second `jakarta.persistence.lock.timeout`, so a stuck transaction fails fast with a `409 Conflict` instead of hanging the connection pool indefinitely.

### 3. Request Lifecycle (Rate Limiting)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Incoming request to /api/**] --> B{JWT present & valid?}
    B -- yes --> C[Identity = user email]
    B -- no --> D[Identity = caller IP]
    C --> E[Bucket key = identity + controller#method]
    D --> E
    E --> F{Caffeine cache: bucket exists?}
    F -- no --> G[Create Bucket4j bucket\ncapacity/refill from @RateLimit,\nor 60/min default]
    F -- yes --> H[Reuse existing bucket]
    G --> I{Token available?}
    H --> I
    I -- yes --> J[Consume 1 token\nadd Rate-Limit-Remaining header\nproceed to controller]
    I -- no --> K[429 Too Many Requests\n+ Retry-After header]
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java 17+** (JDK 21+ recommended — see the virtual-threads note in [Limitations](#-known-limitations--findings))
- **Maven 3.6+** (or use the bundled `./mvnw`)
- **MySQL + Redis** (existing containers or the optional Docker Compose stack)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muhaimin-Mukammel/Banking-System.git
cd Banking-System
```

### 2. Start infrastructure (optional)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This starts:
- **MySQL 8.4** on host port `3307` → container `3306` (database `banking_system`, user/pass `banking`/`banking`)
- **Redis 7** on host port `6380`

If MySQL and Redis are already running at ports `3306` and `6379`, skip this step; the dev profile below is configured for those existing services. If you use this Compose stack, change the dev profile to MySQL `localhost:3307` with `banking`/`banking` and Redis port `6380`.

> On Docker Compose V2, use `docker compose` (no hyphen).

### 3. Review configuration

`src/main/resources/application.properties` (shared):
```properties
spring.application.name=Banking_System
spring.profiles.active=dev
jwt.expiration-ms=86400000        # 24 hours
spring.data.redis.host=localhost
spring.data.redis.port=6379
springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=true
```

`src/main/resources/application-dev.properties` (dev profile):
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/banking_system
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=
server.port=8081
spring.docker.compose.enabled=false

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate     # Flyway owns the schema
spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate=true

jwt.secret=Y2hhbmdlLXRoaXMtc2VjcmV0LWtleS1mb3ItcHJvZHVjdGlvbi11c2Utb25seSE=
```

> **⚠️ Before deploying anywhere real:** replace `jwt.secret` with a freshly generated Base64 256-bit key (`openssl rand -base64 32`) and move it — and the datasource credentials — out of version control (e.g. environment variables or a secrets manager). The committed value is a placeholder and is **not safe to use in production.**

### 4. Build & run
```bash
# using the Maven wrapper
./mvnw clean install
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
The API starts at **http://localhost:8081**.
Interactive API docs: **http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html**

### 5. Run the test suite
```bash
./mvnw test
```

## 📡 API Reference

Every `/api/**` route is rate-limited (default **60 requests/min**, keyed by authenticated email or, for anonymous callers, by IP). Overridden limits are noted below. Exceeding a limit returns `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After` header.

### Authentication & User — base path `/api/user`

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Rate Limit | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/register` | Public | 5/min | Create a new user account |
| `POST` | `/login` | Public | 10/min | Exchange credentials for a JWT |
| `GET` | `/me` | 🔒 | 60/min | Fetch the caller's profile |
| `PUT` | `/me` | 🔒 | 60/min | Update full name / email |
| `PUT` | `/password` | 🔒 | 30/min | Change password (requires current password) |

### Accounts — base path `/api/account`

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Rate Limit | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/create` | 🔒 | 60/min | Open a new `SAVINGS` or `CURRENT` account |
| `GET` | `/` | 🔒 | 60/min | List accounts owned by the caller |
| `GET` | `/{accountId}` | 🔒 | 60/min | Fetch an account owned by the caller |
| `POST` | `/{accountId}/deposit` | 🔒 | 20/min | Credit the account |
| `POST` | `/{accountId}/withdraw` | 🔒 | 20/min | Debit the account (fails on insufficient funds) |
| `POST` | `/transfer` | 🔒 | 20/min | Transfer internally by sender and receiver account numbers |
| `POST` | `/transfer/interbank` | 🔒 | 20/min | Record a simulated interbank request as `PENDING`; no debit or external settlement |

### Transactions — base path `/api/transaction`

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/` | 🔒 | All transactions where the caller is sender or receiver |
| `GET` | `/{transactionId}` | 🔒 | A single transaction (caller must be sender or receiver) |
| `GET` | `/account/{accountId}` | 🔒 | Transaction history for one owned account, newest first |

### Sample error envelope
Every failure — validation, business rule, or unexpected exception — returns a consistent shape:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-07-09T10:15:30",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Insufficient balance for this withdrawal",
  "path": "/api/account/42/withdraw",
  "validationErrors": null
}
```

## 🔐 Security Deep Dive

- **Stateless JWT auth**: `JwtService` signs tokens with HMAC-SHA256 using a Base64-decoded secret (enforced ≥ 32 bytes at startup — the app refuses to boot with a weak key). Tokens carry the user's email as `sub`, an `iat`, and a 24-hour `exp`.
- **`JwtAuthenticationFilter`** runs once per request (`OncePerRequestFilter`), reads the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, and — if the signature and expiry check out — sets a `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` with **no granted authorities** on the `SecurityContext`. Swagger and API-docs paths are explicitly bypassed.
- **`SecurityConfig`** disables CSRF (appropriate for a stateless, non-browser-session API), forces `SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS`, whitelists `/api/user/register`, `/api/user/login`, and the Swagger paths, and requires authentication for everything else.
- **Password storage**: `BCryptPasswordEncoder` with default cost factor; the raw password is never logged, persisted, or echoed back (`@JsonIgnore` on `User.password`).
- **Authorization** (as opposed to authentication) is enforced **per-service-method**, not by Spring Security roles: `SecurityUtils.getCurrentUserEmail()` pulls the authenticated principal, and each service method explicitly checks `account.getUser().getId().equals(currentUser.getId())` before allowing access.

## ⚙️ Concurrency & Data Integrity

Money-moving code is the part of any banking system where subtle bugs are most expensive, and this project takes it seriously:

- **Pessimistic row locking**: every balance mutation (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `transfer`) acquires a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` lock (`AccountRepository.findByIdForUpdate`) with a **5-second lock timeout**, so a stuck transaction fails fast (`AccountLockTimeoutException` → `409`) instead of hanging.
- **Deadlock avoidance via canonical lock ordering**: transfers always lock the lower account ID before the higher one, regardless of which side is sender or receiver. This is the standard technique for avoiding the classic "A→B and B→A at the same instant" deadlock, and it's implemented correctly here.
- **Optimistic locking as a second line of defense**: `Account.version` is annotated `@Version`, so even outside the explicit pessimistic-lock paths, Hibernate will reject a stale write with an `OptimisticLockException`.
- **Self-transfer guard**: transferring an account to itself is explicitly rejected before any locks are taken.
- **Database-level invariants**: `CHECK (balance >= 0)` and `CHECK (amount > 0)` mean that even a hypothetical application-layer bug cannot write an invalid balance or a zero/negative transaction to disk.
- **`@Transactional` boundaries** wrap every mutating service method, so a failure partway through (e.g., the receiver-side save throwing) rolls back the sender-side change too.

## 🧠 Caching Strategy

Redis backs Spring's `@Cacheable` abstraction (`RedisCacheConfig`), with a 10-minute default TTL, null-value caching disabled, and JSON serialization (Jackson, with polymorphic typing enabled to survive round-tripping generic types).

| Method | Cache name | Key |
|---|---|---|
| `AccountServiceImpl.getAccountById` | `accountCache` | `accountId` |
| `UserServiceImpl.getCurrentUser` | `userCahce` *(sic)* | caller's email |
| `TransactionServiceImpl.getAllTransactions` | `allTransactions` | caller's email |
| `TransactionServiceImpl.getTransactionById` | `transactionById` | `transactionId` |
| `TransactionServiceImpl.getTransactionForAcc` | `transactionsByAccount` | `accountId` |

> See [Known Limitations](#-known-limitations--findings) for an important caveat about how caching interacts with the per-request ownership checks on some of these methods.

## 🧪 Testing

- **61 test methods across 11 files**, combining JUnit 5, Mockito, and Spring's `@WebMvcTest` + `MockMvc` for controller-slice tests, plus `spring-security-test` for auth-aware test contexts.
- **Service layer**: `AccountServiceImplTest` (12 tests — including lock-timeout and insufficient-balance edge cases), `TransactionServiceImplTest` (8), `UserServiceImplTest` (11).
- **Controller layer**: `AccountControllerTest` (5), `UserControllerTest` (5), `TransactionControllerTest` (3).
- **Security layer**: `JwtServiceTest` (4), `JwtAuthenticationFilterTest` (5), `SecurityConfigTest` (4), `SecurityUtillsTest` (3).
- **Smoke test**: `BankingSystemApplicationTests` verifies the Spring context loads.

Run everything:
```bash
./mvnw test
```

## 💪 Strengths — What This Project Gets Right

1. **The transfer-locking design is genuinely correct.** Ordered lock acquisition (`min(id)` → `max(id)`) to prevent deadlocks is a real production technique, not a toy simplification — a lot of portfolio banking projects get this exact scenario wrong.
2. **Database-enforced invariants, not just application-layer trust.** `CHECK` constraints on balance and amount mean the schema itself refuses invalid states.
3. **Money is `BigDecimal`/`DECIMAL(19,2)` everywhere** — no `double`/`float` rounding-error landmines.
4. **Flyway-first schema management** with descriptive column/table comments in the SQL itself, rather than letting Hibernate auto-generate (and silently drift) the schema.
5. **Consistent, well-typed error handling.** One `@RestControllerAdvice`, one JSON error shape, precise HTTP status codes (`404`, `409`, `423`, `429`, etc.) instead of blanket `500`s.
6. **Real rate limiting**, not a decorative annotation — token-bucket semantics via Bucket4j, per-identity keying, and a correct `Retry-After` header.
7. **DTOs as Java records** — immutable, boilerplate-free request/response contracts that can't accidentally leak entity internals (like the password hash) over the wire.
8. **A substantial test suite** covering application services, HTTP adapters, security, and the Spring context.
9. **Self-documenting API** via springdoc/Swagger, generated from the actual controller code rather than hand-maintained separately.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Findings

A close read of the current codebase surfaces some real issues worth knowing about before treating this as production-ready:

- **Cache invalidation is still basic.** Read cache keys include the authenticated email so cached account and transaction data cannot cross user boundaries. Money mutations should add targeted cache eviction before relying on cached responses in a production deployment.
- **No role-based access control.** The JWT filter grants an authenticated principal but **zero** `GrantedAuthority` values — every authenticated user is functionally equivalent at the Spring Security layer. All fine-grained authorization (account ownership, transaction access) is hand-rolled inside service methods rather than declared via `@PreAuthorize` or method security. There is no admin role, no staff role, no scoped API tokens.
- **No token revocation / logout.** JWTs are stateless with a 24-hour expiry and no server-side blacklist or refresh-token rotation. A leaked token remains valid until it naturally expires; there is no way to force-invalidate one.
- **Unbounded list endpoints.** `GET /api/transaction`, `GET /api/transaction/account/{accountId}` return the full result set with no pagination, sorting parameters, or date-range filtering. A long-lived, high-activity account will eventually return an arbitrarily large JSON payload.
- **Two custom exceptions are dead code.** `AccountLockedException` (mapped to `423 Locked`) and `InvalidTransactionException` (mapped to `400`) each have a registered handler in `GlobalExceptionHandler` but are never thrown anywhere in the current codebase — harmless, but suggests planned-but-unfinished functionality (e.g. an explicit account-freeze feature).
- **Virtual threads flag with a JDK-version mismatch risk.** `spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true` is set, but virtual threads require **JDK 21+**; on the documented minimum (JDK 17) Spring Boot silently falls back to platform threads with no warning. Confirm which JDK you're actually running before assuming this setting is doing anything.
- **No account-level statement/export functionality**, no notifications (email/SMS) on transactions, no scheduled/recurring transfers, no multi-currency support, no interest accrual for `SAVINGS` accounts, and no idempotency key on money-movement endpoints (a retried `POST /deposit` after a dropped response is indistinguishable from a second, legitimate deposit).
- **Secrets committed as placeholders, not truly externalized.** `jwt.secret` and the database password live directly in `application-dev.properties` inside the repo. Fine for local development, but there's no `application-prod.properties` example, `.env` template, or documented integration with a secrets manager for real deployment.

None of these are unusual for a project at this stage — they're exactly the kind of findings a thorough code review surfaces before a "portfolio project" becomes a "production system." The core money-movement logic (locking, atomicity, invariants) is the hard part, and it's solid.

## 🗺 Roadmap

- [ ] Scope cache keys to the requesting user on account/transaction read endpoints (see Limitations)
- [ ] Introduce Spring Security roles (`ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_ADMIN`) and method-level `@PreAuthorize`
- [ ] Pagination + filtering on all list endpoints
- [ ] JWT refresh tokens + a revocation/blacklist mechanism
- [ ] Idempotency keys on deposit/withdraw/transfer
- [ ] Remove dead exception classes or wire up the account-lock feature they imply
- [ ] Admin panel / back-office operations
- [ ] Loan management module
- [ ] Email/SMS notifications on transactions
- [ ] Interest accrual for `SAVINGS` accounts
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (build, test, and image publish on push)
- [ ] Production-ready multi-stage Docker build for the application itself (currently only the datastores are containerized)
- [ ] Structured audit logging for security-relevant events (login, password change, large transfers)
- [x] Angular frontend client (`frontend/`)

## Optional MySQL local setup

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

This optional Compose stack exposes MySQL on host port `3307` (database `banking_system`, username/password `banking`) and Redis on `6380`. The committed dev profile instead points to an existing MySQL at `127.0.0.1:3306` and Redis at `6379`. Update the dev profile if you choose this separate Compose stack. Flyway creates the tables on application startup. MySQL data persists in the `mysql-data` volume. These migrations initialize a fresh MySQL database; they do not migrate existing PostgreSQL data. Existing PostgreSQL volumes are not removed.

MySQL uses InnoDB, native ENUM columns, DECIMAL money values, and DATETIME(6) transaction timestamps. Each application connection sets `innodb_lock_wait_timeout=5`. Transaction account references restrict deletion instead of using SET NULL because MySQL disallows that referential action on columns used by CHECK constraints.
